# Brainf*ck

This is a simple implementation of Brainf*ck interpreter in PHP.

## Requirements

This interpreter requires PHP to run. It was tested on PHP 8.1.3, but should work with older versions too.

## Installation

You are able to use the interpreter right after downloading, without installation. But if you'd like to have the command available in terminal without specifying a path to script, you have 2 options:

- add directory with interpreter to system PATH,
- copy/move/link to directory, which already is added to PATH.

## Usage

Assuming you have an interpreter just downloaded from Github and you're in directory containing script, You should use it as follows:

```bash
./brainfuck.php /path/to/sourcefile.b
```

where `sourcefile.b` is Brainf*ck source file.
